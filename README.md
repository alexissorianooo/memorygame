Developer notes: <br />
-I created modal for this project <br />
-I used bg-opacity instead of opacity classname for the modal <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*bg-opacity controls the opacity of the element's background <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*opactiy controls the opacity of the element <br />
